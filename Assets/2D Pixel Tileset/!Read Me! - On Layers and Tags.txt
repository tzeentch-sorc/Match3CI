Thank you for purchasing the 2D Pixel Tileset and/or 3D Pixel Tiles!
Herein are some important usage instructions on how to set up layers and tags for the Tileset to work as much 'out of the box' as possible.
IMPORTANT NOTE: If you already have a layer and tag setup for your project and don't want to overwrite it, see the Manual Setup Tips further below.


---PRE-CONFIGURED TAGS & LAYER SETUP INSTRUCTIONS---
In this main folder of the 2D Pixel Tileset, you may've noticed a .ZIP-archive attached. In the archive, there's a TagManager.asset file.
This TagManager has the sorting layers set up to work with 2DPT, but remember that using this file will overwrite any tags and layers setup already in place.
It is highly recommended that you first go into the ProjectSettings-folder of your project and backup the existing TagManager.asset before proceeding.

Once you're ready to proceed, follow these steps:
1. Open the TagManager .ZIP-archive in the 2D Pixel Tileset main folder.
2. Extract the TagManager.asset file in the archive to your ProjectSettings-folder.
	Example location: <MainProjectFolder>\ProjectSettings\
	When asked to overwrite, choose 'Yes/Overwrite'.
3. You're all set! To ensure that it worked, go into any object or background tile prefab and make sure that its Sorting Layer is set to "Objects" and "Background" respectively.


---MANUAL SETUP TIPS---
If you don't want to overwrite your existing tags and layers setup file, here's a couple of tips on how to assign Sorting Layers to objects and tile pieces.
1. Objects - All Prefabs in the Prefabs\Objects sub-folder should be assigned a Sorting Layer that is rendered on top of the background tiles.
2. Tiles - Likewise, all Prefabs in Prefabs\Tiles should be assigned a Sorting Layer that is rendered below the Objects.
	This applies to the Shadow Tiles as well.
3. If you're using the included automatic sprite sorting scripts, be sure to assign the Player Character the same Sorting Layer as the Objects. Otherwise, the player might render always on top of or always below the object sprites.
