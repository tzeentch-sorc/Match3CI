The two scripts used for character movement and automatic sprite sorting in the Web Player demo are included as a bonus.
Below are some quick notes on how the scripts work. Remember to also read the instructions on Layers and Tags in the main folder, as sprite sorting depends on it!

>>SpriteSorter notes:
This script automatically sorts sprites depending on Y-position. This is very useful for games that use a top-down perspective, like the old Final Fantasy games.
Note that sorting requires the object to be on a Sorting Layer separate from the background. Otherwise objects may render behind scenery.

>>TopDownCharacter notes:
This is a simple top-down perspective character script, which includes directional/diagonal movement and automatic sprite sorting.
Note that the character should be on the same Sorting Layer as the scenery objects.
Sort order offset should ideally be set to 1, to ensure that the character renders above objects on the same "order in layer", when moving in front of them.
This script requires a rigidbody and collider component, as it uses physics force to move. Refer to the "Wisp" prefab for ideal rigidbody values. Gravity scale must be set to 0!
